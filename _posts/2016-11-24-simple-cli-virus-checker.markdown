Couple of days ago I downloaded an app for mac and I suspected it was a virus. Since I donâ€™t have an antivirus, I decided that it would be too risky to run the app without making sure I wonâ€™t suffer from any ransomware this winter.

Thereâ€™s a nice service called  [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) which allows you to upload a file, it then scans it using the most common antiviruses and shows you which ones think the file is malicious and which donâ€™t.

The only problem is that the file was pretty big (~300MB) and I didnâ€™t want to waste time uploading it to VirusTotal on the super slow Israeli upload bandwidth. Lucky for me, VirusTotal allow doing the same operation by entering the  [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) of the file.

Since Iâ€™m lazy as hell, getting the checksum of the file and searching for it on VirusTotal every time I wanted to check a file seemed too difficult; So I wrote a bash function that does it for me ðŸ™‚

```bash
# Ephi's virus checker
 export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8
 export VT_API_KEY=""
 
function isvirus {
     CHECKSUM="$(md5 -q $1)"
     curl -sS --request POST --url 'https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/file/report' -d   apikey=${VT_API_KEY} -d "resource=${CHECKSUM}" | \
     python -c "import sys, json; parsed = json.load(sys.stdin); print 'Don\\'t know..' if 'positives' not in parsed else 'nope..' if parsed['positives'] == 0 else 'yep..'"
 }
 # End Ephi's virus checker
```

Just copy and paste it into the end of your  `.bashrc` file (itâ€™s located in your home directory), replace the VirusTotal api key with your key (you can obtain one for free by signing up to VirusTotal) and then run  `source ~/.bashrc` or reopen your terminal and youâ€™re good to go!

To use this function just type  `isvirus FILENAME.EXTENTION` in the terminal, and it would print either  `Don't know` ,  `yep` or `nope` .. Simple as that!
