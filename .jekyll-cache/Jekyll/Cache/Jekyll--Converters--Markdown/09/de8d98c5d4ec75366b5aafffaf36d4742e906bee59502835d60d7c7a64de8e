I"š<p>There is this cool restaurant that my girlfriend and I like to visit called  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gordosrestaurant/">Gordos</a>. This place serves some awesome good looking burgers and milkshakes.<br />
Recently I heard some rumors about a secret menu they have. I googled a bit, and found out that there is actually a secret menu and itâ€™s hidden in their mobile app. According to what people say on the internet, in order to find the secret menu you have to click an item in the regular menu, and the secret menu would just pop.<br />
I tried clicking items on the menu for a couple of minutes, but with no success. So I decided to go deeper.</p>
