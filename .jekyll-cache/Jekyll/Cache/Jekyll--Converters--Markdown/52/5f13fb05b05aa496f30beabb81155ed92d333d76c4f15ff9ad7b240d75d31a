I"8<p>A while ago I noticed the similarity between how a git repository is structured to a chat. So I decided to write the completely not useful yet funny version of a chat client that uses git server as the backend server.</p>

<p>This chat client uses the branches in a git repository as the channels in the chat, and commit messages as actual messages.</p>

<p>You can clone the client from here: https://github.com/ephigabay/GIC</p>

<p>In order to run it you should run  <code>npm install</code> in the directory you cloned the client to, edit the  <code>config.js</code> file and enter a git repository you have access to and then run the client using  <code>npm start</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Be aware that this client will create branches and add commits to the repository you entered there, so be careful.</strong></p>
